# job-employment-canada-dashboard
Using PowerBI & Statistics Canada data, I present you a dashboard which will help to make better decision: <br>
where you should try to settle and search for your next job?

Dataset URL : https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410032601

Using Dashboard, one can decide which province is better to settle as per his/her field or industry of work after checking where most jobs are available, checking wage comparisons etc
